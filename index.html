                    Alison Colao has spent the last seven years working for a prominent commercial real estate tech company where she has
                    dedicated her skills and expertise.
                    However, driven by a desire for personal growth and a keen interest in technology, Alison decided to embark on a career
                    change. Eager to explore new horizons, she enrolled in a full stack web development bootcamp, immersing herself in an
                    intensive learning experience.
                    During the bootcamp, Alison has delved into various programming languages, frameworks, and tools, acquiring a
                    comprehensive skill set required for full stack web development.
                    To showcase her newfound skills and expertise, Alison worked on numerous projects, developing a portfolio that
                    exemplifies her ability to create innovative and functional web applications. Her portfolio stands as a testament to her
                    creativity, problem-solving abilities, and commitment to delivering high-quality work.
                    Equipped with a solid foundation in front and back-end web development, Alison is looking forward to making a successful
                    transition into a new career path in full stack web development.
